//! This crate provides a helper type for a slice of [`IoVec`]s for zero-copy
//! functionality to bound iovecs by a byte count and to advance the buffer
//! cursor after partial vectored IO.
//!
//! # Bounding input buffers
//!
//! This is most useful when writing to a portion of a file while ensuring
//! that the file is not extended if the input buffers are larger than the
//! length of the file slice, which in the torrent scenario may occur if the
//! file is not a multiple of the block size.
//!
//! If the total size of the buffers exceeds the max length, the buffers are
//! split such that the first half returned is the portion of the buffers
//! that can be written to the file, while the second half is the remainder
//! of the buffer, to be used later. If the size of the total size of the
//! buffers is smaller than or equal to the slice, this is essentially
//! a noop.
//!
//! In reality, the situation here is more complex than just splitting
//! buffers in half, but this is taken care of by the [`IoVecs`]
//! implementation.
//!
//! However, the abstraction leaks through because the iovec at which the
//! buffers were split may be shrunk to such a size as would enable all
//! buffers to stay within the file slice length. This can be restored using
//! [`IoVecs::into_tail`], but until this is called, the original
//! buffers cannot be used, which is enforced by the borrow checker.
//!
//! # Advancing the write cursor
//!
//! IO syscalls generally don't guarantee writing or filling the input buffers
//! in one system call. This is why these APIs always return the number of bytes
//! transferred, so that calling code can advance the buffer cursor. This
//! functionality implemented by the [`IoVecs::advance`] method, which takes
//! offsets the start of the slices by some number of bytes.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! What follows is a complete example making use of both above mentioned
//! API features.
//!
//! Visualized, this looks like the following:
//!
//! ```text
//! ------------------------------
//! | file slice: 25             |
//! -----------------------------------
//! | block: 16      | block: 16 ^    |
//! -----------------------------^-----
//!                              ^
//!                          split here
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, the first half of the split would be [0, 25), the
//! second half would be [25, 32).
//!
//! ```

//! let blocks =
//!     vec![(0..16).collect::<Vec<u8>>(), (16..32).collect::<Vec<u8>>()];
//! // the raw data is in vecs but file IO works with iovecs, so we need to make
//! // at least one allocation here to get a contiguouos memory region of iovecs
